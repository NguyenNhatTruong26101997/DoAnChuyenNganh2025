This folder contains backups of duplicate/deprecated files moved from the project root to keep the repository tidy.

Moved items:
- `src/` original files (server-side older copy)
  - `db.js`
  - `ai.js`
  - `controllers/authController.js`
  - `routes/api.js`
  - `routes/auth.js`

- `public/` original frontend files (older copy)
  - `index.html`
  - `css/styles.css`
  - `js/main.js`
  - `pages/*.html`

Notes:
- These are safe backups in case you need to restore older versions.
- If everything works with `backend/` and `frontend/`, you can delete `backup/` later.
- This README was created automatically by the cleanup tool.
